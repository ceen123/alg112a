1. **Hilbert's Second Problem**: David Hilbert asked if mathematics' basic principles, particularly arithmetic, are provably consistent. This challenge sought to establish a secure foundation for all mathematical truths, questioning whether the underlying axioms could avoid any contradictions.

2. **Gödel's Completeness and Incompleteness Theorems**: Kurt Gödel's two theorems had profound impacts. The Completeness Theorem asserts that all true mathematical statements can be proven. The Incompleteness Theorem counters this by showing some true statements can't be proven within their system, revealing limitations in formal systems.

3. **Church and Lambda Calculus**: Alonzo Church developed Lambda Calculus, a formal system for expressing computation using function abstraction and application. It laid foundational work for computer programming, emphasizing how functions can be used as the primary building blocks of computation.

4. **Turing, Turing Machines and the Halting Problem**: Alan Turing introduced the concept of Turing Machines, a hypothetical device representing a computer's basic functions. He also formulated the Halting Problem, demonstrating that it's impossible to know whether certain computer programs will ever stop running or run indefinitely.

5. **Chomsky’s Relationship Between Class and Machines**: Noam Chomsky explored the connection between grammatical classes and computational machines. He classified languages into hierarchies based on their complexity and the computational power needed to process them, influencing both linguistics and computer science.

6. **Steven Cook, SAT and NP-Completeness**: Steven Cook introduced the concept of NP-Completeness, with the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) as the first known NP-complete problem. This concept is crucial in computer science, indicating problems that are easy to check but potentially hard to solve.
