1. **Hilbert's Second Problem**: Hilbert's Second Problem is part of a list of 23 unsolved problems in mathematics proposed by David Hilbert in 1900. This specific problem asks whether the axioms of arithmetic (basic math principles) are consistent, meaning they don't lead to contradictions. It's about making sure that the very foundations of mathematics don't have any inherent problems that would make them unreliable.

2. **Gödel's Completeness and Incompleteness Theorems**: Gödel's theorems are two fundamental statements in mathematical logic. The Completeness Theorem states that every true mathematical statement can be proven in a logical system. On the other hand, the Incompleteness Theorem shows that in any sufficiently complex mathematical system, there are statements that are true but cannot be proven within that system. This was groundbreaking because it showed that there are limits to what we can know in mathematics.

3. **Church and Lambda Calculus**: Alonzo Church created Lambda Calculus, a system of mathematical logic focused on functions. It's a way of describing functions and how they are applied. Lambda Calculus is fundamental in computer science, especially in the study of programming languages and computation theory. It helps us understand how computer programs can be transformed and manipulated.

4. **Turing, Turing Machines, and the Halting Problem**: Alan Turing developed the concept of Turing Machines, which are simple abstract devices used to model computation. These machines can read, write, or erase symbols on a tape and move the tape left or right. The Halting Problem, introduced by Turing, is a question about whether there is a general method to determine if a Turing Machine will ever stop running. Turing proved that such a method does not exist, showing the limits of computation.

5. **Chomsky’s Relationship Between Class and Machines**: Noam Chomsky, primarily known for his work in linguistics, also contributed to the field of computer science. He classified languages (like programming languages) into different categories based on their complexity. This classification helps in understanding how different computational machines (like computers) can process different types of languages or grammatical structures.

6. **Steven Cook, SAT and NP-Complete**: Steven Cook is famous for introducing the concept of NP-Completeness in computational theory. NP-Complete problems, like the SAT (Boolean satisfiability) problem, are those for which solutions can be checked quickly, but finding a solution might take a very long time. This concept is important in computer science because it helps categorize problems based on their difficulty and solvability, impacting fields like cryptography, algorithm design, and more.
